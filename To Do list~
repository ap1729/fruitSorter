Fruit is to be photographed
	Sensor analog data is read and a message is sent to python
	Image taking is done in python with an attached webcam
	Image processing needs to be done in python
		Final Grade needs to be decided
	Python needs to send 'fruitData' back to arduino in the form of 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E'(default)
Arduino once got the data needs to wait for IR sensor
Then the platform needs to be set at the right moment
Then needs to be reset for the next fruit(depending on fruit grade)
