# fruitSorter
Part of the PS1 work @ CEERI, Chennai

The Online Fruit Sorting system is planned to be a completely autonomous system of sorting fruits into baskets of seperate grades.
The grades are currently set based on sizes of the imaged fruits but will eventually be very easy to change as we try to adopt a modular approach in our code.

There are two major peices of code, one to run on a computer(written in python) and one to be uploaded onto the microcontroller; in our case an Arduino and therefore a .ino file.
