# fruitSorter
Part of the PS1 work @ CEERI, Chennai

The Online Fruit Sorting system is planned to be a completely autonomous system of sorting fruits into baskets of seperate grades.
The grades are currently set based on radii of the imaged fruits.
This can easily be modded as we have adopted a modular approach in our code.

There are two major peices of code.
	1) To be run on a computer(written in python); .py file
	2) To be uploaded onto a microcontroller; in our case an Arduino and therefore a .ino file.
